<ul>
    <li><strong>1 cup</strong>	samp — soaked overnight or at least 2 hours</li>
    <li><strong>1 cup</strong>	sugar beans — soaked overnight or at least 2 hours</li>
    <li><strong>500 g</strong>	lamb knuckles</li>
    <li><strong>2 </strong> onions— finely chopped</li>
    <li><strong>2</strong>	garlic cloves — finely crushed</li>
    <li><strong>2 tbsp</strong>	vegetable oil</li>
    <li><strong>2 cubes</strong> lamb stock</li>
    <li><strong>500 ml</strong>	water</li>
    <li><strong>1</strong> bay leaf</li>
    <li><strong>2 tsp</strong>	dried mixed herbs</li>
    <li><strong>1 tsp</strong>	salt</li>
    <li><strong>1/2 tsp</strong>	ground white pepper</li>
    <li><strong>3 tbsp</strong>	butter</li>
    <li><strong>2 tbsp</strong>	fresh parsley — chopped to garnish</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Method</strong></p>
<p>Rinse the samp and beans and remove any impurities. Place the washed samp and beans in a bowl and soak overnight (soak in 1 L of cold water).</p>
<p>Drain the samp and beans and place in large saucepan. Add boiling water to the samp and beans (add enough water to cover the samp and beans).</p>
<p>Bring to the boil, once boiling reduce the heat and allow to simmer for 1 hour to soften. Stir every 30 minutes and add water whilst cooking 
    if necessary.</p>
<p>In a separate heavy-based saucepan heat the oil and fry the onions and garlic until tender.</p>
<p>Add the lamb knuckles and allow to brown.  Add the crumbled stock cubes, bay leaf, mixed herbs, and water. Simmer for 1 ½ hours.</p>
<p>Add the cooked samp and beans and simmer for a further hour, stirring occasionally to avoid burning and until the samp and beans are soft and a thick, 
    rich creamy gravy has formed, and the meat is tender.</p>
<p>Stir through the butter/chicken fat with a wooden spoon, taste and add salt and pepper if required. Serve with chopped parsley.</p>
